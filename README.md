# EQDS
This is just a C written project about how I got my Earthquake Detector Sensor using Arduino project working.

##Abstract
The project Earthquake Detector Sensor using Arduino is aimed to make an alarm when a certain earthquake is detected and automatically makes an alarm immediately. Trial and error were conducted during programming the accelerometer. In this case, the Accelerometer sends signals to the board that detects every movement of the surface, when the project is placed steadily the accelerometer sends signals to the board telling it that its steady until you move the system which sends the command to the board and then activating the buzzer telling the surrounding areas that an earthquake has been detected. During testing, a single wooden plank was used to simulate its accuracy and delay of detection. Results revealed that there is significant difference between different magnitudes detected by the program with a p-value of 0.0256 as interpreted statistically using Two Factor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). It is less than the set level of significance Î± = 0.05 thus, the result is significant. This means that there is enough evidence claiming that the Arduino-based Earthquake Detector Sensor can detect earthquakes on any surfaces and can send alarms to people in an area.
